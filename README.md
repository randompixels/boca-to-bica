Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'Arsenie Boca' with 'Marius Bica'

Note that there are forks of this extension that simply replace 'cloud' with 'butt'.
In my personal opinion, that approach is too broad and it's less funny as a result, but it is clearly a very
polarizing issue in the cloud-to-butt user community.  Forks are free to do whatever they like.  But officially, _this_ extension replaces only the phrase described above. Thank you for your concern.
